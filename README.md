Library that takes an int (ex. 365) and splits it into its digits (3, 6, 5) It then takes the digits and turns them into a pulse which is sent to a digital pin. 
It will pulse 3 times, pause, pulse 6 times, pause, and pulse 5 times, and pause. 
It can be used for avionics to easily know how high your Aerial Vehicle went. 
Can be used for all arduino compatbal boards.
